<h2>Is buying an imported car harder then buying a domestic car?</h2> 

<p>Absolutely not! Buying a car from us is just as easy as going to your local car dealership and buying a car from there!</p>

<h2>How do I purchase a car?</h2>

<p>Just click on a car you think you'd like and we'll get into contact with you as soon as we're available!</p>

<h2>Do you offer any financing?</h2>

<p>unfortunately not. At this time you will have to either get a personal loan from a bank or buy the vehicle in full</p>

<h2>Do you guys send cars to houses?</h2>

<p>Absolutely! We will ship a car all aross the U.S!</p>

<h2>Will you import any cars younger the 25 years old?</h2>

<p>Not a chance. Importing cars under 25 years old is against the law and we here at Moore Imports are not criminals</p>
